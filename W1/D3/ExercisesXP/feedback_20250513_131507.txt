suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the bonus part could be improved by adding input validation to ensure the user enters a valid integer for the age.
- Exercise 3 could benefit from more robust error handling.  For example, checking if keys exist before attempting to access or modify them. The bonus part could also include a check to prevent overwriting existing 'creation_date' and 'number_stores' keys.
- The comments in the code are good, but could be more descriptive in places, especially clarifying the logic behind certain decisions (like the use of ternary operators).
- While the code correctly implements the functionality, consider adding more descriptive variable names where possible to enhance readability (e.g., instead of 'users', perhaps 'disney_characters').
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses all the requirements of the exercises, fulfilling the described functionalities in each section. The only minor deviation is the lack of input validation and more robust error handling in some parts, which doesn't impact core functionality but reduces the robustness of the solution.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow, but some variable names could be more descriptive. The use of ternary operators in Exercise 2 enhances conciseness but could also reduce readability for those less familiar with the syntax.  Adding more detailed comments would further improve this.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient. It uses appropriate data structures and algorithms, avoiding unnecessary computations.  The algorithms used have a time complexity that aligns well with the expected input sizes.
- security: The code doesn't present any security vulnerabilities.  It operates solely on provided data and doesn't interact with external resources in a way that could introduce security risks.
