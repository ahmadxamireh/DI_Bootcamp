# Exercise 1: Concatenate lists
# Instructions
# Write code that concatenates two lists together without using the + sign.

first_list = list(range(0, 5))
second_list = list(range(5, 10))
combined_lists = first_list + second_list
print(f'The concatenated list is: {combined_lists}')

# Exercise 2: Range of numbers
# Instructions
# Create a loop that goes from 1500 to 2500 and prints all multiples of 5 and 7.

for i in range(1500, 2500):
    if i % 5 == 0 or i % 7 == 0:
        print(i)

# Exercise 3: Check the index
# Instructions
# Using this variable
# names = ['Samus', 'Cortana', 'V', 'Link', 'Mario', 'Cortana', 'Samus']
# Ask a user for their name, if their name is in the names list print out the index of the first occurence of the name.
# Example: if input is 'Cortana' we should be printing the index 1

# Exercise 4: Greatest Number
# Instructions
# Ask the user for 3 numbers and print the greatest number.
# Test Data
# Input the 1st number: 25
# Input the 2nd number: 78
# Input the 3rd number: 87
# The greatest number is: 87

# Exercise 5: The Alphabet
# Instructions
# Create a string of all the letters in the alphabet
# Loop over each letter and print a message that contains the letter and whether it's a vowel or a consonant.

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for letter in alphabet:
    if letter in 'aeiou':

# Exercise 6: Words and letters
# Instructions
# Ask a user for 7 words, store them in a list named words.
# Ask the user for a single character, store it in a variable called letter.
# Loop through the words list and print the index of the first appearence of the letter variable in each word of the list.
# If the letter doesnâ€™t exist in one of the words, print a friendly message with the word and the letter.

        print(f'The letter {letter} does not appear in the word {word}.')

# Exercise 7: Min, Max, Sum
# Instructions
# Create a list of numbers from one to one million and then use min() and max()
# to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million.
# Use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can add a million numbers.

numbers_list = list(range(1, 1_000_001))  # list of numbers from 1 to 1 million inclusive

# Exercise 8 : List and Tuple
# Instructions
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
# Generate a list and a tuple which contain every number.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98
# Then, the output should be:
# ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
# ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

# Exercise 9 : Random number
# Instructions
# Ask the user to input a number from 1 to 9 (including).
# Get a random number between 1 and 9. Hint: random module.
# If the user guesses the correct number print a message that says Winner.
# If the user guesses the wrong number print a message that says better luck next time.
