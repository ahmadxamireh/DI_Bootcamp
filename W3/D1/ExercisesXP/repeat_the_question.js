let number;

do {
    number = prompt("Please enter a number:");
    number = Number(number); // convert string to number

    if (isNaN(number)) { // if the input was not a number
        alert("That's not a valid number. Try again.");
    }
} while (isNaN(number) || number < 10); // if the input is not a number or is less than 10, repeat the loop.

console.log("You entered a number greater than or equal to 10:", number);
