suggestions for improvement:
- The single loop solution is very concise and efficient.  Consider adding a comment explaining the use of `.trim()`.
- The nested loop solution is clear but could benefit from more descriptive variable names (e.g., `numberOfStars` instead of `i` and `j`).
- Both solutions efficiently generate the output; there's no significant performance bottleneck in either approach for this scale of problem. For larger outputs, consider alternative string concatenation techniques for improved performance.
- While not strictly necessary here, for larger-scale string manipulation it may be beneficial to explore using a StringBuilder-like approach in languages where string concatenation is less performant.
