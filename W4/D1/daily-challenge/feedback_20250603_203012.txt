suggestions for improvement:
- Use `const` instead of `let` for `finalScore` to reflect its immutability after initialization.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `usernamesWithExclamation` instead of `usernames`).
- For larger datasets,  `reduce` would be slightly more performant than `forEach` for calculating the total score.
Correctness: 100%
