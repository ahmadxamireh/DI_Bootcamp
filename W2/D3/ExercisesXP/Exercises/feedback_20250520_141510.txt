suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the docstrings are excellent, but consider adding type hints for better readability and maintainability.  For example: `def __init__(self, currency: str, amount: int):`
- In Exercise 1,  the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are almost identical. While this works, consider if a more distinct `__repr__` is needed for debugging purposes (maybe including the object's memory address).
- In Exercise 7, there's a minor typo:  `'langauge_code'` should be `'language_code'`.
