suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file should include error handling for file I/O operations, especially the `open()` function.  Consider using a `try-except` block to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` or `IOError` exceptions and handle them gracefully.
- Improve efficiency of `get_anagrams` by pre-filtering words based on length before comparing letter counts. This avoids unnecessary calls to `is_anagram`.
- Add more comprehensive docstrings to methods, explaining parameter types and return values more explicitly.
- The `anagrams.py` file is missing; the instructions clearly state it should exist and handle user interaction.  The solution is incomplete without it.
- The code lacks input validation in `AnagramChecker.is_valid_word` to explicitly check for the presence of only alphabetic characters.  Using `isalpha()` is a good start, but consider also checking for spaces and other non-alphabetic characters.

suggestions for improvement:
- The program abruptly exits after finding anagrams or determining a word is invalid.  It should return to the main menu instead.
- Error handling could be improved. Instead of just printing error messages, consider using exceptions for better structure and potentially more informative error messages.
- The `exit_program()` function is unnecessarily complex.  A simple `exit()` or `return` would suffice.
- The nested loops make the code a little harder to follow. Consider restructuring the input and validation steps for better clarity.
- The performance could be improved by optimizing the anagram search algorithm within `AnagramChecker`. Consider using a more efficient approach, especially for longer words.
