# üåü Anagram checker
# We will create a program that will ask the user for a word.
# It will check if the word is a valid English word, and then find all possible anagrams for that word.
#
#
#
# Instructions
#
# 1. Create a new file called anagram_checker.py which contains a class called AnagramChecker.

    A class for checking words against a predefined valid word list and finding anagrams.

    This class provides functionality to verify if a word exists in the word list,
    and to find all possible anagrams for a given word. The word list is loaded
    from a text file during initialization. The user functions include checking
    for the validity of a word and retrieving anagrams.
