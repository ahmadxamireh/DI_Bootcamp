suggestions for improvement:
- The `get_short_info` method's handling of pluralization could be improved for better readability and maintainability. Consider using a more concise and general approach instead of special handling for 'sheep'.
- Add docstrings to all methods for better code understanding and maintainability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all the requirements specified in the Chapter Content/Questions.  The `Farm` class accurately creates and manages the animal dictionary, uses string formatting for output as requested in the get_info method, and correctly implements the bonus methods `get_animal_types` and `get_short_info` which return the appropriate values as described. The test case's output matches the example.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow.  Variable names are descriptive.  The use of f-strings enhances readability in the `get_info` method. However, the pluralization logic in `get_short_info` could be simplified.  Adding docstrings would further improve readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task. The algorithms used are optimal for the operations performed, with no unnecessary computations or loops.  The use of the `sorted()` function in `get_animal_types` ensures efficient sorting.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the provided code. It doesn't handle external input or interact with any sensitive data.
