# Exercise: Call History
#
# Instructions
#
# 1. Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. When instantiating an object create
# an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.
class Phone:
    """
    Represents a mobile phone with functionalities to make calls, send messages, and view call/message logs.

    The Phone class provides basic features for simulating interactions between phone objects, including recording call
    history, sending and receiving messages, and displaying logs. It supports operations such as tracking outgoing and
    incoming messages and filtering messages based on sender.

    :ivar phone_number: Phone number associated with the instance.
    :ivar call_history: List recording all call logs made by or to this phone.
    :ivar messages: List containing message logs in dictionary format with keys: 'to', 'from', 'content'.

    def __init__(self, phone_number):

        self.messages = []

    # 2. Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters. The
    # method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phoneâ€™s call_history.

    # 4. Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.

    # 5. Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. Each message should be saved as a
    # dictionary with the following keys:
