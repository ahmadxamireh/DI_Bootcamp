# üåü Exercise 1: Random Sentence Generator
# Goal: Create a program that generates a random sentence of a specified length from a word list.
#
# Key Python Topics:
#
# File handling (open(), read())
# Lists
# Random number generation (random.choice())
# String manipulation (split(), join(), lower())
# Error handling (try, except)
# Input validation
#
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1. Download the provided word list and save it in your development directory.
# 2. Create a function to read the words from the file.
# 3. Create a function to generate a random sentence of a given length.
# 4. Create a main function to handle user input and program flow.
#
#
# Step 1: Create the get_words_from_file function
# Create a function named get_words_from_file that takes the file path as an argument.
# Open the file in read mode ("r").
# Read the file content.
# Split the content into a list of words.
# Return the list of words.
import random


def get_words_from_file(path: str):
    """
    Reads a file, processes its content, and extracts words into a list. The function
    ensures safe file handling by using a context manager and handles specific exceptions
    like file not found or input/output errors.

    It attempts to open the file at the given path in read mode and reads all lines in the
    file. The lines are joined into a single string, and words within the string are
    extracted by splitting on whitespace.

    :param path: The path to the file to be read and processed, provided as a string.
    :type path: str
    :return: A list of words extracted from the file, or None if the file is not found
        or if an error occurs during reading.

# Create a function named get_random_sentence that takes the sentence length as an argument.

# Create a sentence with the selected words.
# Convert the sentence to lowercase.

    output.

# üåü Exercise 2: Working with JSON
# Goal: Access a nested key in a JSON string, add a new key, and save the modified JSON to a file.

# Key Python Topics:

# JSON parsing (json.loads())
# JSON serialization (json.dump())
# Dictionaries

# Using the follow code:

# "YYYY-MM-DD".
# Save the modified JSON to a file.
#
#
# Step 1: Load the JSON string
# Import the json module.
# Use json.loads() to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary.

# Step 2: Access the nested ‚Äúsalary‚Äù key
# Access the ‚Äúsalary‚Äù key using nested dictionary access (e.g., data["company"]["employee"]["payable"]["salary"]).
# Print the value of the ‚Äúsalary‚Äù key.

# Replace "YYYY-MM-DD" with an actual date.
