üåü Exercise 1: Class with Access Modifiers
1. Create a class Employee with the following properties:
    - A private property name of type string.
    - A private property salary of type number.
    - A public property position of type string.
    - A protected property department of type string.
2. Also, include a constructor to initialize these properties.
3. Create a public method getEmployeeInfo that returns the employee‚Äôs name and position.

üåü Exercise 2: Readonly Properties in a Class
1. Create a class Product with the following properties:
    - A readonly property id of type number.
    - A public property name of type string.
    - A public property price of type number.
2. Create a method getProductInfo that returns a string with the product‚Äôs name and price.
3. Attempt to modify the id property after creating a new instance of the class and observe the result.

Observation:
- compile-time error: Cannot assign to id because it is a read-only property.
- readonly in TypeScript only exists at compile-time.
- It does not prevent changes at runtime in JavaScript.

üåü Exercise 3: Class Inheritance
1. Create a base class Animal with a public property name, and a method makeSound that returns a string.
2. Create a subclass Dog that extends Animal and overrides the makeSound method to return the sound a dog makes (‚Äúbark‚Äù).
3. Create an instance of the Dog class and call the makeSound method.

üåü Exercise 4: Static Properties and Methods
1. Create a class Calculator with the following static methods:
    - add(a: number, b: number): number ‚Äì returns the sum of two numbers.
    - subtract(a: number, b: number): number ‚Äì returns the difference between two numbers.
2. Call these methods without creating an instance of the class.

1. Create an interface User with properties id (readonly), name, and email.
2. Extend the User interface to create a PremiumUser interface with an additional optional property membershipLevel.
